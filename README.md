## Looking for Help?

No problem! There are a variety of resources available to get you up and running, and sprinting once you're up and running.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/robertinant/EnergiaNG/issues) - This very page!
* [Download](http://energia.nu/download/) - Download a compiled application for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
* [Website](http://energia.nu) - Full documentation including tutorials, reference, pins maps, FAQ and much more!
* [Forum at 43oh](http://forum.43oh.com/forum/28-energia/) - A community around the original LaunchPad  but also the newer ones.
* [Bug report](https://github.com/robertinant/EnergiaNG/issues) - Is something not working as it ought to? Or better yet, is there something we could make better?
